# Anime Data Analysis and Visualization

This project explores an anime dataset, performs data cleaning, analysis, and visualizes the results.

## Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Columns like "Members" are cleaned and formatted for numerical analysis.
2. **Data Analysis**: We analyze the top-rated anime and most popular anime.
3. **Visualization**: Bar charts are created for visual insights.
4. **Saving Data**: The cleaned dataset is saved as `cleaned_anime_dataset.csv`.

## Files:
- `anime_data_analysis.py`: Python script for analysis and visualization.
- `cleaned_anime_dataset.csv`: Cleaned dataset.
- `graphs/`: Folder containing visualizations.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Python script using a Jupyter notebook or in your local environment.
3. The cleaned dataset will be saved as `cleaned_anime_dataset.csv`.
